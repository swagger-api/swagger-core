# Swagger Sample App

## Overview
This is a grails project to build a stand-alone server which implements the Swagger spec.  You can find out more about both the spec and the framework at http://swagger.wordnik.com.  For more information about Wordnik's APIs, please visit http://developer.wordnik.com.  There is an online version similar to this server at http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs.json

### Running the app
You do not need to install Grails separately to run this project.  
    

To start simply run:

```
grailsw run-app
```

This will download required framework files and dependencies and start the app on port 8080.  You can then navigate to the swagger-ui here:

```
http://localhost:8080/java-grails2/index.html
```

Once you start the server, you may see some errors on the console, but they don't appear to affect the operation of swagger.
