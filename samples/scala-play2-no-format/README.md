# Swagger Playframework Sample App

## Overview
This is a scala project to build a stand-alone server which implements the Swagger spec.  You can find out 
more about both the spec and the framework at http://swagger.wordnik.com.  For more information 
about Wordnik's APIs, please visit http://developer.wordnik.com.  There is an online version of this
server at http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs.json

### To build from source
Please follow instructions to build the top-level [swagger-core project](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core)

### To run
The swagger-play2 module lives in a github repository, currently not in maven central.  You'll have to add
a dependency and a resolver to your Build.scala like this:

```scala
  val appDependencies: Seq[sbt.ModuleID] = Seq(
    /* your other dependencies */
    "com.wordnik" %% "swagger-play2" % "1.2.4")

  val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
    Resolver.url("swagger-core-github-repo", url("http://wordnik.github.com/repository"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns),
    /* your other resolvers */
    )
}
```

then you can build the sample app:

````
play run
````

The application will listen on port 9000 and respond to `http://localhost:9000/resources`
