The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.

Swagger-core is the Java implementation of Swagger. Current version supports *JAX-RS2*.

Check out the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for additional information about the Swagger project.

## Overview
This is a project to build the swagger-core library, which is required for the Swagger implementation of the OpenAPI Spec. 

### Change History
If you're interested in the change history of swagger and the swagger-core framework, see [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/releases).

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* Java 8 (http://java.oracle.com)
* Apache maven 3.0.4 or greater (http://maven.apache.org/)
* Jackson 2.4.5 or greater


### To build from source (currently 2.0.3-SNAPSHOT)
```
# first time building locally
mvn -N
```

Subsequent builds:
```
mvn install
```

This will build the modules.

Of course if you don't want to build locally you can grab artifacts from maven central:

`http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/swagger/`

## Sample Apps
The samples have moved to [a new repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-samples/tree/2.0) and contain various integrations and configurations.
